            This Paneer Butter Masala recipe is a rich and creamy dish of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in a tomato, 
            butter and cashew sauce that is known here as “makhani gravy.” 
            The acidity of the tomatoes and the sweetness of the cream make for a velvety, nearly addictive sauce.
